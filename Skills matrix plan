Skills Matrix Notepad

Skill Matrix Feature Planning
After examining the questionnaire document and your current Team Management implementation, I can see we're building a comprehensive Skill Assessment Tool with survey capabilities and visualization features. Let's break down this feature into clear components and devise a plan.
Understanding the Feature

1. Survey Component
Purpose: Collect detailed skill assessments from team members using the 5-point Likert scale
Content: 5 major assessment areas with multiple questions in each (from the attached questionnaire)
Flow: Team members receive a survey link, complete the assessment, and submit responses

2. Reporting Component
Purpose: Visualize the assessment results in a digestible format
Displays:
Skill matrix table (showing scores across all team members and skill areas)
Spider net graphs (visualizing individual and team skill profiles)
Filter/comparison tools to analyze results
Questions for Clarification

User Roles & Access:
Will only directors be able to view the skill matrix reports?
Will team members be able to see their own assessments but not others?

Survey Distribution:
How will team members receive their survey links? (Email, direct link, etc.)
Will surveys be one-time or recurring assessments?

Data Storage:
Should we store historical assessment data for tracking improvement?

Phase 3: Frontend Development - Survey Form
Create Survey Form Components:
SurveyPage.js - Main container for the survey
SurveyCategory.js - Section for each assessment area
LikertQuestion.js - Individual question with 1-5 scale
SurveyNavigation.js - Controls for navigating between sections
SurveySubmit.js - Final submission component
Implement Survey Access Flow:
Team member receives unique URL with access key
Form loads questions based on the access key
Responses are validated and submitted to the backend

Phase 4: Frontend Development - Reporting & Visualization
Create Skill Matrix Components:
SkillMatrixPage.js - Main container for the reporting view
MatrixTable.js - Tabular view of all skills and team members
SpiderGraph.js - Visualization component for skill profiles
FilterControls.js - UI for filtering and comparing data
Implement Visualization Features:
Use a charting library like Chart.js or D3.js for spider net graphs
Add filtering capabilities (by team member, skill category, etc.)
Enable comparisons between team members or teams

Phase 5: Integration & Testing
Connect Team Management to Survey System:
Add "Send Survey" action in the Team Management page
Show survey completion status for each team member
Implement notifications for survey assignments and completions
Testing:
Test survey form with various input scenarios
Validate visualization accuracy
Check mobile responsiveness
Conduct usability testing with sample users

Timeline Estimate
| Phase | Estimated Duration | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 | 3-5 days | Database schema updates |
| 2 | 5-7 days | Backend API development |
| 3 | 7-10 days | Survey form frontend development |
| 4 | 7-10 days | Reporting & visualization frontend development |
| 5 | 5-7 days | Integration and testing |
Total Estimated Time: 4-6 weeks (depending on complexity and resources)

Recommended Next Actions
Finalize the database schema based on any additional requirements
Set up the new database tables
Start implementing the backend API endpoints for survey management
Create wireframes for the survey form and reporting views
Begin frontend component development for the survey form
