VI. Project Timeline (12 Weeks Total):

Week 1-2: Back-End Setup and Authentication
Week 3-4: Team Management and Survey Generation
Week 5-6: Front-End Login and Team Management
Week 7-8: Survey Page Implementation
Week 9-10: Skill Matrix Dashboard
Week 11-12: Testing, Deployment, and Documentation
VII. Risk Management:

Risk: API endpoint errors.
Mitigation: Implement robust error handling and logging.
Risk: Database connection issues.
Mitigation: Configure database connection settings carefully and test thoroughly.
Risk: Front-end routing issues.
Mitigation: Test routing thoroughly with different scenarios.
Risk: Time constraints.
Mitigation: Prioritize core features and maintain clear communication.
VIII. Communication Plan:

Regular team meetings for progress updates.
Use a project management tool (e.g., Trello, Jira) for task tracking.
Maintain clear communication channels (e.g., Slack, email).
This plan provides a structured approach to building the Product Skill Assessment Tool. It can be adjusted based on project progress and feedback.
